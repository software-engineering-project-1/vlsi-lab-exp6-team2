* Objective 
  To test the movability of the components on the grid
* Pre conditions 
  The plugin should be installed in the browser and the experiment
  applet must be running.
* Post conditions 
  The components are cumbersome to be operated on. There are no clear
  instructions on their behavior.
* Test Steps 
  Step-1: Visit the link: http://cse14-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/EXP_1sep2010/exp6/exp6_latch_positive.html
  Step-2: Select any of the components and try to move them in the grid.
* Expected result 
  The applet must only display those components that are required of
  the experiment.
